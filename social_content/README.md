# lazyPR Social Media Content Summary

## Overview

Created a **4-day launch series** documenting the completion of lazyPR Batch 1 (Issues #4-7). Content focuses on **problems solved**, not features shipped.

## Content Strategy

### Core Philosophy Applied
✅ **Problem-first messaging** - Every post starts with developer pain
✅ **"Lazy but efficient" tone** - Punchy, relatable, professional  
✅ **Actionable insights** - Show value, don't just tell
✅ **Community-focused** - Invite engagement and contribution

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** Senior/Staff engineers reviewing code daily
- **Secondary:** Engineering managers improving team processes
- **Tertiary:** Open source contributors and maintainers

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1: Ticket Detection (Issue #4)
**Problem:** Hunting through JIRA/Linear/GitHub for ticket context
**Hook:** "Ever read a PR and wonder 'what ticket is this even for?'"
**Value:** Context without the detective work

### Day 2: Title Enhancement (Issue #5)
**Problem:** Vague PR titles like "fix bug" and "update stuff"
**Hook:** "We've all done it. 'Fix bug.' 'Update stuff.'"
**Value:** Descriptive titles without manual effort

### Day 3: Custom Placeholders (Issue #6)
**Problem:** Generic templates that don't fit team workflows
**Hook:** "One-size-fits-all templates actually fit no one well"
**Value:** Your process, automated

### Day 4: Size Detection (Issue #7)
**Problem:** 3,000-line PRs that sit unreviewed for days
**Hook:** "Your heart sinks. This will take an hour to review properly."
**Value:** Visibility drives better PR hygiene

## Content Deliverables

### Twitter/X Posts: 12 total
- Day 1: 2 posts
- Day 2: 2 posts  
- Day 3: 2 posts

## Key Messaging Themes

1. **Friction elimination** - "Stop hunting, start reviewing"
2. **Context surfacing** - "What you need to know, automatically"
3. **Workflow integration** - "Works where you work"
4. **Team standards** - "Gentle enforcement, better habits"
5. **Open extensibility** - "Your process, not ours"

## Engagement Hooks

- Questions: "What's your biggest PR review pain point?"
- Polls: Vote on favorite feature
- CTAs: "Try it: github.com/elvis-ike/lazypr"
- Community: "What should we build in Batch 2?"
